Welcome to Week 0! In this note, you'll learn the basics of computational thinking and how to start programming with Scratch.

## What is Computational Thinking?
Computational thinking is a problem-solving process that includes (but is not limited to) the following characteristics:
- Decomposition: Breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- Pattern Recognition: Observing patterns, trends, and regularities in data.
- Abstraction: Identifying the general principles that generate these patterns.
- Algorithms: Developing step-by-step solutions to problems.

## Getting Started with Scratch
Scratch is a visual programming language that helps you learn the logic of coding without worrying about syntax. You can create interactive stories, games, and animations.

### Example: Hello World in Python
```python
for i in range(3):
    print("Hello, UET Learning!", i)
```

### Tips for Success
- Experiment with blocks in Scratch.
- Try to make your character say hello and move.
- Add loops and conditions to make your project interactive.

Happy coding!
