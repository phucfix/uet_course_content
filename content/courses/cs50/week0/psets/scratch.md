## Problem to Solve

It's time to choose your own adventure! Your assignment, quite simply, is to implement in Scratch, at [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu), any project of your choice, be it an interactive story, game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:

## Requirements

Your project must use Scratch 3.0.

Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.

Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).

Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.

Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via **Make a Block**), which must take at least one input.

Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and [Ivy's Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433).

## Ideas

Here are just a few ideas for your project:

- An interactive greeting that asks for the user's name and responds with a personalized hello.
- A simple game where a character must avoid obstacles.
- An animation that tells a short story.
- A quiz that asks multiple-choice questions and keeps score.
- A musical instrument that plays sounds when keys are pressed.

## How to Begin

1. Go to [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu) and click **Start Creating** to begin.
2. Click on **File** → **Save to your computer** periodically to save your work.
3. Once finished, click **File** → **Save to your computer** one last time to download your `.sb3` file.

## Specification

- Your project should incorporate a minimum level of complexity (per the requirements above).
- Creativity is encouraged! Make something you're proud of.
- You must submit a `.sb3` file, which is the file format for Scratch 3.0 projects.
