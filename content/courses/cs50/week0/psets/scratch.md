### Scratch Project

Create a Scratch project where your character says hello and moves around the stage. Add at least one loop to make the character repeat an action, such as moving or changing color.

**Ideas:**
- Make your character dance or jump.
- Add sound effects when the character says hello.
- Use loops to create animations or repeated actions.

Share your project with your classmates!
