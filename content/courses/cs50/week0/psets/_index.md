Welcome to the Week 0 Problem Sets! Here you'll practice your first programming skills with Scratch and Mario challenges.

## Mario
Build a half-pyramid using hashes (#) in your favorite language. This helps you understand loops and basic output.

## Scratch
Create a simple Scratch project that says hello and uses at least one loop. Try to make your character move and interact with the environment.

Good luck and have fun!
