&lt;p&gt;Suppose you work at a store and a customer gives you $1.00 (100 cents) for candy that costs $0.50 (50 cents). You&amp;rsquo;ll need to pay them their &amp;ldquo;change,&amp;rdquo; the amount left over after paying for the cost of the candy. When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you&amp;rsquo;re dispensing for each customer, lest you run out (or annoy the customer!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a file called &lt;code&gt;cash.c&lt;/code&gt;, implement a program in C that prints the minimum coins needed to make the given amount of change, in cents, as in the below:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Credit</title><link>/courses/cs50/weeks/1/psets/credit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/courses/cs50/weeks/1/psets/credit/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="problem-to-solve"&gt;Problem to Solve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A credit (or debit) card, of course, is a plastic card with which you can pay for goods and services. Printed on that card is a number that&amp;rsquo;s also stored in a database somewhere, so that when your card is used to buy something, the creditor knows whom to bill. There are a lot of people with credit cards in this world, so those numbers are pretty long: American Express uses 15-digit numbers, MasterCard uses 16-digit numbers, and Visa uses 13- and 16-digit numbers.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
